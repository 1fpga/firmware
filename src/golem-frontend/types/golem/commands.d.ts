// Type definitions for the `@/golem/commands` module in Golem Script.

/**
 * This module provides functions to interact with commands in Golem Script.
 * Commands can be shortcuts or scripted actions that can be executed by the user.
 *
 * Commands come in 3 variations:
 *
 * 1. a `GeneralCommand` is a command that is executed in any context, whether
 *    the user is in the main menu or in a game.
 * 2. a `CoreCommand` is a command that is executed only when the user is
 *    running a core.
 * 3. a `CoreSpecificCommand` is a command that is executed only when the user
 *    is running a specific core.
